## 📋 **Before You Begin**

### **Prerequisites:**

✅ Completed Level 1: Noob → Nerd  
✅ Understand lists and dictionaries from [Session 7](docs/sessions/L1/08_S7.md) and [Session 8](docs/sessions/L1/09_S8.md)  
✅ Know how to iterate over collections  
✅ Comfortable with basic Python syntax

---

## 💻 **Part 1: Sets - Unique Collections**

### **What is a Set?**

A **set** is a collection of unique items - no duplicates allowed! Think of it like a mathematical set or a unique list.

**Key Characteristics:**

- ✅ Contains only unique elements (duplicates automatically removed)
- ✅ Unordered (no index positions)
- ✅ Mutable (you can add/remove items)
- ✅ Perfect for membership testing (checking if something exists)

### **Creating Sets**

You can create sets in two ways:

```python
# Method 1: Using curly braces
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange"}
print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'orange'}

# Method 2: Using set() function
numbers = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Empty set (must use set(), not {})
empty_set = set()
```

**Important:** `{}` creates an empty dictionary, not an empty set! Use `set()` for empty sets.

### **Why Sets Are Useful**

Sets automatically remove duplicates:

```python
# List with duplicates
scores = [85, 90, 85, 92, 90, 88, 85]
print(scores)  # [85, 90, 85, 92, 90, 88, 85]

# Convert to set to get unique values
unique_scores = set(scores)
print(unique_scores)  # {85, 88, 90, 92} - duplicates removed!
```

---

## 💻 **Part 2: Set Operations**

### **Adding and Removing Elements**

```python
colors = {"red", "blue"}

# Add single element
colors.add("green")
print(colors)  # {'red', 'blue', 'green'}

# Add multiple elements
colors.update(["yellow", "purple"])
print(colors)  # {'red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'purple'}

# Remove element
colors.remove("blue")
print(colors)  # {'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'purple'}

# Remove safely (won't error if not found)
colors.discard("pink")  # No error even though 'pink' doesn't exist
```

### **Set Operations: Union, Intersection, Difference**

Sets support mathematical operations:

```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set_b = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Union: All elements from both sets
union = set_a | set_b  # or set_a.union(set_b)
print(union)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Intersection: Elements in both sets
intersection = set_a & set_b  # or set_a.intersection(set_b)
print(intersection)  # {4, 5}

# Difference: Elements in set_a but not in set_b
difference = set_a - set_b  # or set_a.difference(set_b)
print(difference)  # {1, 2, 3}
```

### **Membership Testing**

Sets are perfect for checking if something exists:

```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange"}

# Check membership (very fast!)
if "apple" in fruits:
    print("Apple is in the set!")

# Much faster than checking in a list for large collections
```

## 💻 **Part 3: Tuples - Immutable Sequences**

### **What is a Tuple?**

A **tuple** is like a list, but **immutable** (cannot be changed after creation). Think of it as a "locked" list.

**Key Characteristics:**

- ✅ Ordered (has index positions)
- ✅ Immutable (cannot add, remove, or modify items)
- ✅ Can contain duplicates
- ✅ Faster than lists for some operations
- ✅ Can be used as dictionary keys (lists cannot!)

### **Creating Tuples**

```python
# Method 1: Using parentheses
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates)  # (10, 20)

# Method 2: Without parentheses (comma makes it a tuple)
point = 10, 20
print(point)  # (10, 20)

# Single element tuple (note the comma!)
single = (42,)  # Comma is required!
not_a_tuple = (42)  # This is just the number 42

# Empty tuple
empty = ()
```

### **When to Use Tuples vs Lists**

**Use Tuples when:**

- ✅ Data should not change (coordinates, RGB colors, dates)
- ✅ Using as dictionary keys
- ✅ Returning multiple values from a function
- ✅ Performance matters (tuples are slightly faster)

**Use Lists when:**

- ✅ You need to add/remove/modify items
- ✅ Order matters and may change
- ✅ You need list methods (append, remove, etc.)

---

## 💻 **Part 4: Working with Tuples**

### **Accessing Tuple Elements**

Tuples work like lists for accessing elements:

```python
person = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")

# Access by index
name = person[0]      # "Alice"
age = person[1]       # 25
job = person[2]       # "Engineer"

# Slicing works too
first_two = person[:2]  # ("Alice", 25)
```

### **Tuple Unpacking**

A powerful feature of tuples:

```python
# Unpack tuple into variables
name, age, job = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")
print(name)  # "Alice"
print(age)   # 25
print(job)   # "Engineer"

# Useful for returning multiple values from functions
def get_name_age():
    return "Bob", 30

name, age = get_name_age()
```

### **Tuples as Dictionary Keys**

Unlike lists, tuples can be dictionary keys:

```python
# Valid: Tuple as key
locations = {
    (10, 20): "Home",
    (30, 40): "Office",
    (50, 60): "Park"
}
print(locations[(10, 20)])  # "Home"

# Invalid: List as key (would cause error)
# locations = {[10, 20]: "Home"}  # TypeError!
```

---

## 💻 **Part 5: Choosing the Right Data Structure**

### **Decision Guide**

| Need | Use | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Unique items, no duplicates | Set | Automatic duplicate removal |
| Fast membership testing | Set | Optimized for "in" checks |
| Ordered, changeable | List | Can modify, add, remove |
| Ordered, unchangeable | Tuple | Immutable, can be dictionary key |
| Key-value pairs | Dictionary | Perfect for relationships |

### **Practical Examples**

```python
# Set: Unique student IDs
student_ids = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1001}  # Duplicate removed
print(student_ids)  # {1001, 1002, 1003}

# Tuple: RGB color (shouldn't change)
red_color = (255, 0, 0)
# red_color[0] = 200  # Error! Tuples are immutable

# List: Shopping cart (changes frequently)
cart = ["apple", "banana"]
cart.append("orange")  # Can modify

# Dictionary: Student grades
grades = {"Alice": 95, "Bob": 87}
```

# Coordinate point (shouldn't change)
point_a = (10, 20)
point_b = (30, 40)

print("Point A:", point_a)
print("Point B:", point_b)

# Unpacking tuples
x, y = point_a
print(f"X coordinate: {x}, Y coordinate: {y}")

# Person information (immutable)
person = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")
name, age, job = person
print(f"{name} is {age} years old and works as a {job}")

# Using tuple as dictionary key
locations = {
    (0, 0): "Origin",
    (10, 20): "Home",

## 📝 **Key Takeaways**

- **Sets** are unique collections - perfect for removing duplicates and fast membership testing
- **Tuples** are immutable sequences - use when data shouldn't change
- **Set operations** (union, intersection, difference) are powerful for data manipulation
- **Tuple unpacking** is elegant for working with multiple values
- **Choose the right structure** based on your needs: mutability, uniqueness, ordering

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

**Issue:** `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` when using list as dictionary key  
**Solution:** Use a tuple instead - tuples are hashable and can be dictionary keys

**Issue:** Trying to modify a tuple  
**Solution:** Tuples are immutable. If you need to change values, use a list instead

**Issue:** Empty set confusion  
**Solution:** Use `set()` for empty set, not `{}` (that's an empty dictionary)
