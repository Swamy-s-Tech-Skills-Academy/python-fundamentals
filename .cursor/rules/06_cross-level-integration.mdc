## 🔗 Cross-Level Integration

All new content must connect to:

- Upstream prerequisites (previous sessions/levels)
- Peer topics it builds upon (same level, earlier sessions)
- Downstream applications it enables (later sessions/levels)
- Related concepts across the curriculum

**Connection Pattern**:

```markdown
## 📅 Session Flow

| Part | Activity | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1    | Review   | Concepts from Session X |
| 2    | Learn    | New concepts building on Session Y |
| 3    | Practice  | Apply concepts for Session Z |

## 🔗 Related Sessions

**Prerequisites**:
- [Session X](docs/sessions/L1/0X_SX.md) - Required concepts

**Builds Upon**:
- [Session Y](docs/sessions/L1/0Y_SY.md) - Foundational concepts

**Enables**:
- [Session Z](docs/sessions/L1/0Z_SZ.md) - Advanced applications
```

## Integration Requirements

When creating content, always:

1. **Identify Prerequisites**: What sessions must learners complete first?
2. **Link to Foundations**: What does this session build upon?
3. **Show Applications**: What sessions does this enable?
4. **Cross-Reference**: Connect to related concepts across levels
5. **Level Mapping**: Which level does this content belong to?
